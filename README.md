# Stock_Market_Prediction.
This a simple project or may be minor version of a Machine Learning code that predicts the stock market.
The code loads and preprocesses stock price data.
- It creates moving averages as new features.
- It splits the data into training and testing sets.
- It trains a random forest regressor on the training data.
- It evaluates the model’s performance using mean squared error.
- It plots the actual versus predicted prices for visual comparison.
